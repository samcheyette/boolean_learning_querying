        In this experiment, you will be repeatedly shown an array of 16 objects, with all objects initially placed in the center of the screen. Each object is secretly a member of one of two categories (A and B), represented by a bin above (category A) and a bin below (category B) the objects. Your job is to figure out which category each object belongs to. You will get a bonus depending on your ability to correctly categorize each object.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>
           There are two phases in each trial: a LEARNING phase and a GUESSING phase. In the LEARNING phase, you can double-click any object to reveal its category. In the GUESSING phase, you will click on an object and categorize it with the up and down arrow keys.

        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p>

        You can make up to a $0.32 bonus on each trial: each correct guess will earn you $0.02; however, each incorrect guess will lose you $0.02 (if you have a negative bonus at the end of the experiment, your bonus will be set to $0.00). However, you will only be able to make guesses in the GUESSING phase about the objects that you did NOT already select in the LEARNING phase!
